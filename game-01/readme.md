# Game 01

Let M be a not empty set of integer numbers, find all subsets of M which sum N.
For instance, let's say we've got a set of number [5, 2, 8, 14, 0] and N = 24, the resulting subset should be [2, 8, 14].

## Challenge
You're required to create a function that receives an array (M) and integer value (N), this function has to return an array of all the possible solutions
